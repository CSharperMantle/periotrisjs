          Periotris.js is your best companion for learning and memorizing the
          Periodic Table of Elements.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Combining the classic game experience of Tetris with the periodic
          table, Periotris.js is a successful attempt of breathing vitality into
          the boredom of chemistry learning.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The rumor that periodic table is constructed out of a game of Tetris
          has been brought to reality. By playing Periotris.js you can
          experience the thrill of fitting elements into right slots like a real
          chemist. Despite its simplicity, Periotris.js is a challenging game
          that puts the player&apos;s knowledge of descriptive chemistry to the
          test. Try finish the game in the shortest time possible and experience
          the excitement of completing another brick in the wall of chemistry.

          sparking the idea that finally went so far as this.
